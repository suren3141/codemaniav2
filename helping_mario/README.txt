## Helping Mario

### Description

Mario the plumber is on an adventure.
He has a set of pipes with equal diameter and a cylindrical bag with slightly higher diameter and a maximum capacity to carry them.
He wants to maximize the number of pipes he can carry.
Given the lengths of each pipe and the maximum capacity (length) of the bag, ca you help him to maximize the number of pipes?

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The following $2T$ lines describe the test cases as follows:

- Each test case is described by 2 lines

- The first line contains two space separated integers, $l$ and $n$, where $l$ denotes the maximum capacity of the cylinder and $n$ denotes the number of the total number of pipes available.

- The second line contains $n$ space separated positive integers $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ indicating the length of each pipe to be arranged.

### Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 10$

$1 \leq l \leq 10^9$

$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$

$1 \leq x_i \leq 10^5$

### Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer $m$ which denotes the maximum number of pipes that can be fit inside the bag.
