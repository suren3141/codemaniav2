## Costly palindromes

### Description

You are given a string containing lower case letters.
Your objective is to find the "palindrome cost" which is the minimal number of characters which must be removed such that the resulting string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
A [palindrome](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/palindrome-examples.html) is a string which reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

Each of the $T$ following lines contain an integer $n$ and a string $s$, where $n$ represents the length of the string and $s$ is the string for which you're required to find the palindrome cost.


### Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 100$

$1 \leq n \leq 10^4$

The string $s$ contains only lower case ASCII characters.

### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer representing the palindrome cost.
