EXPLANATION

There are $5$ publications and $3$ queries.

- The first query is "Beta" who has 2 publications with citations : [5, 3]. As "Beta" has 2 publications, both with more than 2 citations, the h-index is 2.
- The second query is "Alpha" who has 4 publications with citations : [5, 1, 3, 3]. As "Alpha" has 3 publications with atleast 3 citations, the h-index is 3. (Not 4 as all 4 publications do not have atleast 4 citations.)
- The thirst query is "Kappa" who doesn't have any publications. So the h-index is 0.
